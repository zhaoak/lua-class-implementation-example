# Lua Class Implementation Example 

This is an example of an implementation of classes in Lua, a feature found in many object oriented languages like Java and C++, along with extensive commenting explaining what each snippet does.

Lua has no native support for classes, but it's fairly simple to implement them using tables and their metamethod functionality (see the Links section below for more information.)

This code is primarily a more throughly commented version of the code found [here](http://lua-users.org/wiki/ObjectOrientationTutorial).
